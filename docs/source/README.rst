BoxQP
-----

The box-constrained quadratic programming (BoxQP) problem is a
non-convex continuous-variable optimization problem written formally as:

.. math::


   \begin{split}
   \text{maximize} & \quad f(x) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1}^N Q_{ij} x_i x_j  + \sum_{I=1}^N V_i x_i \\
   \text{subject to} & \quad l_i \le x_i \le u_i \quad \forall i \in \{1,\cdots, N\}.
   \end{split}

Here, :math:`f(x)` is the objective function described by the
:math:`N\times N` :math:`Q` matrix and the :math:`V` vector of size
:math:`N`. The second line describes the box constraint. Here the
default values for limits of the box constraint are :math:`0` and
:math:`1`, i.e., :math:`l_i = 0` and :math:`u_i = 1` for all :math:`i`
in :math:`\{1,\cdots,N\}`.

The CCVM receives the ``Q`` matrix and the ``V`` vector of the BoxQP
problem and implements the derivative of the objective function into the
CCVM solver. For implementing the box constraint, the amplitudes of the
variable are either clamped between the lower and the upper values of
the box constraints, as is the case with the BMF-CCVM, PMF-CCVM,
MF-CCVM, Langevin, and pumped-Langevin solvers, or the saturation
process in the CCVM is used to implement this constraints as is the case
with the DL-CCVM solver. The default box constraint limits are and for
all variables.

Problem instance files
----------------------

In the current folder structure, there is a folder inside the `examples` folder named
`benchmarking_instances`, which contains subfolders of randomly generated instances of various sizes. There is also a subfolder containing a single instance, which can be used as an example problem set to quickly run the scripts in the `examples` folder.
Within each subfolder of `benchmarking_instances`, the contained problems have the same properties except that different seed numbers have been used to generate them.

Format of the instance file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first line of each instance file contains the following information,
in this order: - instance size - optimum solution (example files used
the Gurobi solver to determine these values) - whether the solution is
optimal (``True`` or ``False``) - the seed number used for generating
the instance in ``torch``.

The second line contains the elements of the vector ``V``, which
describes the instance.

The rest of the lines hold the elements of the ``Q`` matrix.

You can specify a file delimiter of your choice. Then remember to
provide it when initializing the ProblemInstance.

::

   boxqp_instance = ProblemInstance(
       instance_type="test",
       file_path="./examples/single_test_instance/test020-100-10.in",
       device=solver.device,
       file_delimiter="YOUR CHOICE",
   )

If you donâ€™t provide it, the default file delimiter is tab (``\t``).
