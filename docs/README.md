# Documentation

Due to the capabilities of Sphinx, a programme that automatically generates documentation from the docstrings in the code files, manually writing out documentation for the `ccvm_simulators` package is not necessary. Before creating a pull request, however, the documentation should be locally built to ensure any new docstrings have been properly included.

## How to generate documentation

- Deployed documentation: the documentation is automatically generated by a GitHub Actions pipeline when a  pull request is merged to main.
- Local documentation: validate documentation before creating PRs by running `sphinx-build docs/source  _build` from the root folder
    - Documentation is generated in the `_build` folder
    - `_build/index.html` holds the documentation's homepage

## How to update READMEs containing mathematical formulas

- It is necessary to convert all README files that include mathematical formulas to RST format using an     online converter such as [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/md-to-rst)
- Replace the old README file in docs/source folder (e.g. `docs/source/README.rst`) with the newly converted RST file
- Generate documentation by running `sphinx-build docs/source _build` from the root folder
- Validate the documentation in the `_build` folder
